Users care about speed but also care if a webpage looks decent. Creating a project with core CSS gives more freedom and variety in design usually, so this project was mainly to test out the various possible UI functions of chakra-UI paired with TailwindCSS, while also creating something functional and practical for real world scenarios. Making a full stack app like this with the usual CSS approach would've definitely taken longer. Either that or I've just got to get lightning McQueen faster at them. I'll take that challenge. Alright for those who don't care about design: a future addition that could make this website better is probably adding an admin dashboard perspective, with options to edit the services provided. Oooh maybe even customers getting to make an account where they could see their past transactions.
